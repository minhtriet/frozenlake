i think that the code is a bit too much, and am greatly appreciated if a kind person out there can do a full review, however if for any reason it is not reasonable, here are some of the most pressing concerns
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    this->schedule.push(start_state);
    this->step.insert(std::pair<Point, int>(start_state, 0));
    std::vector<Point> visited;
